## Contributions

The [Whitespace programming language](http://compsoc.dur.ac.uk/whitespace/index.php) and its original Haskell implementation were authored by [Edwin Brady](https://github.com/edwinb); Cabal support added by [@haroldl](https://github.com/haroldl) ([haroldl/whitespace-nd](https://github.com/haroldl/whitespace-nd)).

The great idea of [GrassMudHorse programming language](http://code.google.com/p/grass-mud-horse/) was proposed by [@bearice](https://github.com/bearice).
